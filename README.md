# 30Days_Of_Productivity
I am taking up the <b>30DaysOfProductivity</b> challenge by [<b>CodeChef SRM RMP</b>](https://twitter.com/CodeChefSrmRmp)🔥My goal is to be productive for 30 Days straight🧑‍💻<br>
It has been a while since I have completed the [100Days Of Code](https://github.com/SiddharthaBhattacharjee/100Days-of-Code) challenge, It is about time to get my consistancy challenged again.<br>
This time around the rules are slightly different from before , The rules are mentioned in the [Rules.md]() file📃<br>
To track the challenge progress , check out the [logs.md]() file📖<br>
<br>
I hope to improve my consistency as well as my skills by taking part in this challenge and I recomend everyone to take up the challenge and complete it.<br>
As it is famously said "Consistency is the key to success" and "Motivation is temporary, consistancy is permanent"<br>
Thank you CodeChef SRM RMP Family for starting this wonderful challenge, it is sure to make a great and consistant work environment in the Club.
