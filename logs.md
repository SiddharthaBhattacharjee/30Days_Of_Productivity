# 30 Days of Productivity : 
This is the daily log of my activities in 30Days of Productivity challenge, I'll be updating my daily productive activities along with the code link (github push links) in this file so that anyone can keep track of and validate my progress.
This can be treated as my proof of work for the challenge.

- ## Day-0 , 22nd Jan 2023 :
    Today, I declared that I will be taking on the challenge on twitter and GitHub.📢 I prepared the Repository for the challenge (The one we are currently on) and took the time to lay the description and rules of the challenge.
    From Tomorrow , I'll start the challenge and I'll start updating this log record page regularly. Keep an eye out for my tweets on my [twitter account](https://twitter.com/Siddhartha_2345) to stay updated.
    
- ## Day-1 , 23rd Jan 2023 :
    Today, I started working on a Decentralized App (D-app) Project called Password Wallet D-app, This app helps you to store the passwords to all your different miscilinious accounts securely in the block-chain. Your metamask wallet acts as your authentication, i.e. you only need to load in with your metamask wallet to access your passwords , no one else can access the passwords you have saved.🗒️<br>
    I have completed the server side of the project today, which included writing the smart contract (in solidity), writing tests and testing the contract with chai and hardhat and lastly deploying the contract in the blockchain network (I used shardeum network to host my contract, as it is cheaper and faster).💻<br>
    It took me 2 Hrs and 37 mins to complete todays coding work⏱️<br>

- ## Day-2 , 24th Jan 2023 :
    Today, I started working on the Frontend of the Password Walled Decentralised Application project. I am working with ReactJS for the front end of the project.🗒️<br>
    I have completed the essential parts of the frontend which includes fetching data from block-chain, displaying data, adding and deleting data to the block-chain, a loading screen while wallet is being connected, as well as a way to keep the passwords hidden in the screen.💻 More featured to be added tomorrow.<br>
    It took me 3 Hrs and 20 mins to complete todays coding work⏱️<br>

- ## Day-3 , 25th Jan 2023 :
    Today, I continued on the Decentralised Application project I started working on and I have finished both client and blockchain side of the project. i.e. The project is completed!🎊 First project down under 30DaysOfProductivity, many more projects to work on and much more to learn.📈<br>
    Continued from where I left behind yesterday, added the generate password feature that generates random password for users to use, added the edit and copy button alongside the data, implemented the function to allow data editing.💻.<br>
    It took me 5 Hrs and 20 mins to complete todays coding work⏱️ (including looong debugging sessions 🥲)<br>

- ## Day-4 , 26th Jan 2023 :
    Today, I created a new smartcontract in solidity and hardhat.📃<br>
    This smartcontract is for a custom virtual token system and includes functions to add, subtract, read, and transfer tokens between users. I created this as a general purpose virtual token contract which can be used in various future projects. Used Solidity to write the contract and HardHat and Chai to run tests on the contract.💻 THE CONTRACT ALSO WORKS ON REMIX IDE AND CAN BE TESTED EASILY THERE.<br>
    It took me 3 Hrs to complete todays coding work⏱️ <br>

- ## Day-5 , 27th Jan 2023 :
    Today, I went to Satyabama University Chennai to organise the Shardeum Campus awareness workshop with [Prayasu Bro](https://twitter.com/ThePrayasu), check out the [tweet](https://twitter.com/Siddhartha_2345/status/1619016774527373314) to know more. Other than that , I created a new voting system smartcontract in solidity using Remix IDE.📃<br>
    In DAOs (Decentralised Autonomous Organisations) there is no higherarchy, the members earn points by contributing to the DAO and each point allows them to cast a vote in any desigion making of the DAO. SO the more a member contributes to the DAO, the more desigion making power they have.👥 In this smart contract, I created the same system of point based voting structure of a DAO using solidity. Created this contract on Remix ide using solidity, the purpose being to practice and improve my solidity smart contracts, and these general purpose contracts might be used in future projects.💻<br>
    Also updated our class time table Android app by adding the latest time table and the new classroom number/lab venue data.📱<br>
    It took me 1 Hr 40 mins to complete todays coding work⏱️ (on top of 4 hrs webinar + 3 hrs of travel time 🥲 It's been an exhausting day.) <br>

- ## Day-6 , 28th Jan 2023 :
    Today, I have started to learn Backend development with NodeJS , ExpressJS and MongoDB, I have started following a free cource by FreeCodeCamp on Youtube.▶️<br>
    click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe421EPjeBE) to checkout the cource.<br>
    Today , I got to learn about the basics of Node JS , its use cases, how its different from normal JS, about how to use the REPL and CLI , how to execute in node JS, Global variables ( \_\_dirname ,\_\_filename, require, module, process), modules and how to export in modules .💻 Wrote some code while learning since the cource is hands on.<br>
    It took me 2 Hrs to complete todays coding work⏱️ (Including the handwriten notes I am taking from the cource) <br>

- ## SUNDAY , 29th Jan 2023 :
    sundays are break day !

- ## Day-7 , 30th Jan 2023 :
    Today, I created two new smartcontracts in solidity using Remix IDE.📃<br>
    The first one is the game highscore smart contract that keeps the highscore of a game in the blockchain immutablely making it secure, second one is a message storing smart contract, it is a contract that allows users to send and recieve uneditable and undeletable permanent messages, which makes it very secure for various trust purposes such as aggrements💻.<br>
    Also, Today I went to SRM KTR campus for the Shardeum Campus Workshop event, it was a log journey to both get there and to come back, and hence I was very exhausted to continue the backend course today, I will resume the course from tomorrow!<br>
    It took me 1 Hrs to complete todays coding work⏱️ <br>
