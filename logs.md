# 30 Days of Productivity : 
This is the daily log of my activities in 30Days of Productivity challenge, I'll be updating my daily productive activities along with the code link (github push links) in this file so that anyone can keep track of and validate my progress.
This can be treated as my proof of work for the challenge.

- ## Day-0 , 22nd Jan 2023 :
    Today, I declared that I will be taking on the challenge on twitter and GitHub.ðŸ“¢ I prepared the Repository for the challenge (The one we are currently on) and took the time to lay the description and rules of the challenge.
    From Tomorrow , I'll start the challenge and I'll start updating this log record page regularly. Keep an eye out for my tweets on my [twitter account](https://twitter.com/Siddhartha_2345) to stay updated.
