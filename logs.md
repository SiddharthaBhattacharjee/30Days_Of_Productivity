# 30 Days of Productivity : 
This is the daily log of my activities in 30Days of Productivity challenge, I'll be updating my daily productive activities along with the code link (github push links) in this file so that anyone can keep track of and validate my progress.
This can be treated as my proof of work for the challenge.

- ## Day-0 , 22nd Jan 2023 :
    Today, I declared that I will be taking on the challenge on twitter and GitHub.📢 I prepared the Repository for the challenge (The one we are currently on) and took the time to lay the description and rules of the challenge.
    From Tomorrow , I'll start the challenge and I'll start updating this log record page regularly. Keep an eye out for my tweets on my [twitter account](https://twitter.com/Siddhartha_2345) to stay updated.
    
- ## Day-1 , 23rd Jan 2023 :
    Today, I started working on a Decentralized App (D-app) Project called Password Wallet D-app, This app helps you to store the passwords to all your different miscilinious accounts securely in the block-chain. Your metamask wallet acts as your authentication, i.e. you only need to load in with your metamask wallet to access your passwords , no one else can access the passwords you have saved.🗒️<br>
    I have completed the server side of the project today, which included writing the smart contract (in solidity), writing tests and testing the contract with chai and hardhat and lastly deploying the contract in the blockchain network (I used shardeum network to host my contract, as it is cheaper and faster).💻<br>
    It took me 2 Hrs and 37 mins to complete todays coding work⏱️<br>

- ## Day-2 , 24th Jan 2023 :
    Today, I started working on the Frontend of the Password Walled Decentralised Application project. I am working with ReactJS for the front end of the project.🗒️<br>
    I have completed the essential parts of the frontend which includes fetching data from block-chain, displaying data, adding and deleting data to the block-chain, a loading screen while wallet is being connected, as well as a way to keep the passwords hidden in the screen.💻 More featured to be added tomorrow.<br>
    It took me 3 Hrs and 20 mins to complete todays coding work⏱️<br>

- ## Day-3 , 25th Jan 2023 :
    Today, I continued on the Decentralised Application project I started working on and I have finished both client and blockchain side of the project. i.e. The project is completed!🎊 First project down under 30DaysOfProductivity, many more projects to work on and much more to learn.📈<br>
    Continued from where I left behind yesterday, added the generate password feature that generates random password for users to use, added the edit and copy button alongside the data, implemented the function to allow data editing.💻.<br>
    It took me 5 Hrs and 20 mins to complete todays coding work⏱️ (including looong debugging sessions 🥲)<br>

- ## Day-4 , 26th Jan 2023 :
    Today, I created a new smartcontract in solidity and hardhat.📃<br>
    This smartcontract is for a custom virtual token system and includes functions to add, subtract, read, and transfer tokens between users. I created this as a general purpose virtual token contract which can be used in various future projects. Used Solidity to write the contract and HardHat and Chai to run tests on the contract.💻 THE CONTRACT ALSO WORKS ON REMIX IDE AND CAN BE TESTED EASILY THERE.<br>
    It took me 3 Hrs to complete todays coding work⏱️ <br>

- ## Day-5 , 27th Jan 2023 :
    Today, I went to Satyabama University Chennai to organise the Shardeum Campus awareness workshop with [Prayasu Bro](https://twitter.com/ThePrayasu), check out the [tweet](https://twitter.com/Siddhartha_2345/status/1619016774527373314) to know more. Other than that , I created a new voting system smartcontract in solidity using Remix IDE.📃<br>
    In DAOs (Decentralised Autonomous Organisations) there is no higherarchy, the members earn points by contributing to the DAO and each point allows them to cast a vote in any desigion making of the DAO. SO the more a member contributes to the DAO, the more desigion making power they have.👥 In this smart contract, I created the same system of point based voting structure of a DAO using solidity. Created this contract on Remix ide using solidity, the purpose being to practice and improve my solidity smart contracts, and these general purpose contracts might be used in future projects.💻<br>
    Also updated our class time table Android app by adding the latest time table and the new classroom number/lab venue data.📱<br>
    It took me 1 Hr 40 mins to complete todays coding work⏱️ (on top of 4 hrs webinar + 3 hrs of travel time 🥲 It's been an exhausting day.) <br>

- ## Day-6 , 28th Jan 2023 :
    Today, I have started to learn Backend development with NodeJS , ExpressJS and MongoDB, I have started following a free cource by FreeCodeCamp on Youtube.▶️<br>
    click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe421EPjeBE) to checkout the cource.<br>
    Today , I got to learn about the basics of Node JS , its use cases, how its different from normal JS, about how to use the REPL and CLI , how to execute in node JS, Global variables ( \_\_dirname ,\_\_filename, require, module, process), modules and how to export in modules .💻 Wrote some code while learning since the cource is hands on.<br>
    It took me 2 Hrs to complete todays coding work⏱️ (Including the handwriten notes I am taking from the cource) <br>

- ## SUNDAY , 29th Jan 2023 :
    sundays are break day !

- ## Day-7 , 30th Jan 2023 :
    Today, I created two new smartcontracts in solidity using Remix IDE.📃<br>
    The first one is the game highscore smart contract that keeps the highscore of a game in the blockchain immutablely making it secure, second one is a message storing smart contract, it is a contract that allows users to send and recieve uneditable and undeletable permanent messages, which makes it very secure for various trust purposes such as aggrements💻.<br>
    Also, Today I went to SRM KTR campus for the Shardeum Campus Workshop event, it was a log journey to both get there and to come back, and hence I was very exhausted to continue the backend course today, I will resume the course from tomorrow!<br>

<br>
<br>

# 30 Days of Productivity V2.0 : 
I am taking up the challenge again with everyone else in CodeChef Family. This time we all will be doing it together with an aim to complete the challenge with everyone else and boost our collective productivity to the next level 🔥 Here we go...

- ## Day-1 , 29th March 2023 :
    Today, I started working on complete reconstruction of my Portfolio website. This time I am making it in ReactJS (earlier version is in HTML+CSS+JS and is non responsive too) I will be making huge improvements on the design and performance.🗒️<br>
    I will be working slowly on this project, chipping away at it bit by bit while also working on other more urgent works.<br>
    I have completed implementing the Router Dom structure and completed the Base Layout and the Navbar.💻<br>
    It took me 2 Hrs 20 mins to complete todays coding work⏱️<br>

- ## Day-2 , 30th March 2023 :
    Today, I created simple demo smartcontracts to demonstrate DeFi using Remix IDE. I studied about DeFi to understand the concepts and application of DeFi, and then implemented an ERC20 Token contract and a DeFi contract to demonstrate the concepts. This is in preparation for an upcoming Workshop🗒️<br>
    For this demo, the ERC20 Token will act like our standard token and DeFi is having its own Token which it can give in exchange for ERC20 tokens on Deposit, on withdrawl, the DeFi tokens are destroyed and the ERC20 tokens are returned to the user.💻<br>
    Studied about DeFi, Wrote deployed and Tested the ERC20 & DeFi contracts and tested their integration with each other.✔️<br>
    It took me 3 Hrs 10 mins to complete todays coding work⏱️<br>

- ## Day-3 , 31th March 2023 :
    Today, I continued working on my Portfolio website.🗒️<br>

- ## Day-4 , 1st April 2023 :

    Today, I organised a Shardeum event at Kana Labs office, and studied more about DeFi in preparation for tomorrows event.🗒️<br>

    In the Shardeum event, I discussed about BlockChain, web3 , Shardeum , and demonstrated Smartcontracts and D-apps.💻<br>

    The event was 3 hrs long, I was speaking for 1.5 hrs and Organised for the remaining 1.5 hrs , other than that , studied about DeFi smart contracts for 1 hrs.⏱️<br>

- ## Day-5 , 2nd April 2023 :

    Today, I conducted a workshop on DeFi at IIT Madras in the event organised by Finance Club of IIT Madras.🗒️<br>

    In this workshop, I discussed about BlockChain, DeFi basics and demonstrated a Smartcontract in Solidity which implemented a simple ERC20 and DeFi interaction.💻<br>
