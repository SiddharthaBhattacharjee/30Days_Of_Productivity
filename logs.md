# 30 Days of Productivity : 
This is the daily log of my activities in 30Days of Productivity challenge, I'll be updating my daily productive activities along with the code link (github push links) in this file so that anyone can keep track of and validate my progress.
This can be treated as my proof of work for the challenge.

- ## Day-0 , 22nd Jan 2023 :
    Today, I declared that I will be taking on the challenge on twitter and GitHub.üì¢ I prepared the Repository for the challenge (The one we are currently on) and took the time to lay the description and rules of the challenge.
    From Tomorrow , I'll start the challenge and I'll start updating this log record page regularly. Keep an eye out for my tweets on my [twitter account](https://twitter.com/Siddhartha_2345) to stay updated.
    
- ## Day-1 , 23rd Jan 2023 :
    Today, I started working on a Decentralized App (D-app) Project called Password Wallet D-app, This app helps you to store the passwords to all your different miscilinious accounts securely in the block-chain. Your metamask wallet acts as your authentication, i.e. you only need to load in with your metamask wallet to access your passwords , no one else can access the passwords you have saved.üóíÔ∏è<br>
    I have completed the server side of the project today, which included writing the smart contract (in solidity), writing tests and testing the contract with chai and hardhat and lastly deploying the contract in the blockchain network (I used shardeum network to host my contract, as it is cheaper and faster).üíª<br>
    It took me 2 Hrs and 37 mins to complete todays coding work‚è±Ô∏è<br>
